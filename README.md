# Game Engine 3D

The game engine providing a foundation for game creation.

## Project Description

The engine is in its initial development phase, and many features are still under construction.

- [X] A robust optimisation using CUDA.
- [X] Camera movement.
- [ ] Game editor for the mapping.
- [X] 3D Mathematics for transformations.
- [X] Ray tracing
- [ ] Textures
- [X] Model loading using Blender.
- [ ] Basic physics and collision detection.

And many more...

## Priority

1. GameEngine3D MultiPlatform without RTX and CUDA due to hardware issue.
2. GameEngine3D Windows RTX CUDA.
3. GameEngine3D Python due to performance issue.

## Acronyms

WIN = Windows Only,
CU = was written with CUDA,
MP = Multi-Platform (windows/linux),
RT = Utilize Ray Tracing for lightning (Very resource intensive)
