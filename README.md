# Game Engine 3D

The game engine providing a foundation for game creation.

## Project Description

The engine is in its initial development phase, and many features are still under construction.

### Phase 1
- [ ] A robust optimisation
- [X] Camera movement
- [X] 3D Mathematics for transformations
- [X] Ray tracing
- [ ] Textures
- [X] Model loading using Blender
- [ ] Add a sky and reflect it

### Phase 2
- [ ] Basic physics and collision detection.

### Phase 3
- [ ] Game editor for the mapping.

And many more...

## Priority

1. GameEngine3D Multi-Platform RTX
2. GameEngine3D Multi-Platform
3. GameEngine3D Windows RTX CUDA

(I don't think i will continue the python version due to performance issue)

## Acronyms

WIN = Windows Only,
CU = was written with CUDA,
MP = Multi-Platform (windows/linux),
RT = Utilize Ray Tracing for lightning (Very resource intensive)
